  Args:
    steps: dataset of steps.
    map_fn: function to apply to a batch of steps.
    size: Size of the batch. By default we use a large batch size so many
      episodes will have only one batch element.
    shift: increment to compute the index to start the next batch (shift=1 means
      that we create a batch for each element in the input dataset). Must be
      positive.
    stride: increment to compute the index to select the next element of each
      batch (stride=1 means that we include consecutive elements in the batch).
      Must be positive.

  Returns:
    The unbatched dataset of steps after applying the operation.
