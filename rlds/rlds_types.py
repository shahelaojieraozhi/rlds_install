  Each step encodes the current observation, the action applied to this
  observation, and the reward obtained by applying the action. If the step is
  terminal (i.e., is_terminal=true), the reward, action and discount are
  meaningless as this observation is a terminal state.

  If an episode ends in a step where `is_terminal = False`, it means that this
  episode has been truncated. In this case, depending on the environment, the
  action, reward and discount might be empty as well.


  Args:
    observation: tensor representing the current observation.
    action: tensor representing the action applied after `observation` was made.
    reward: tensor representing the reward obtained as a result of applying
      `action`.
    discount: tensor representing the discount factor (at the same step as the
      `reward`).
    is_terminal: true iff the observation is terminal. Note that `reward` and
      `action` are meaningless if `is_terminal=true`.
    is_first: true iff the observation is the first observation in the episode.
    is_last: true iff the observation is the last observation in the episode.
      When true, `action`, `reward` and `discount` are considered invalid.
