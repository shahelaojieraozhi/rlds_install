# Examples

See how to use RLDS in this
[tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/rlds/blob/main/rlds/examples/rlds_tutorial.ipynb).

    for loading uniformly subsampled RLU Atari datasets such as 1%, 5% and 10%
    Atari datasets, as introduced by
    [Agarwal et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04543) and commonly used
    in offline RL research (e.g., CQL, Decision Transformer, MuZero ReAnalyze).
